<p data-sourcepos="1:1-1:247">"Lilo &amp; Stitch" (2025) is the live-action adaptation of Disney's beloved 2002 animated classic. Directed by Dean Fleischer Camp, the film brings the heartwarming story of an unlikely family to life with a mix of new talent and familiar voices.</p>
<p>Plot Overview:</p>
<p>The story unfolds on the Hawaiian island of Kauaʻi, where Lilo Pelekai (Maia Kealoha), a lonely and eccentric young girl, is struggling to cope with the loss of her parents. Her older sister, Nani (Sydney Elizebeth Agudong), is trying her best to raise Lilo, but their unconventional living situation attracts the attention of social worker Mrs. Kekoa (Tia Carrere).</p>
<p data-sourcepos="6:1-6:362">Simultaneously, across the galaxy, <strong>Experiment 626</strong>, a highly destructive alien creature created by mad scientist Dr. Jumba Jookiba (Zach Galifianakis), escapes captivity and crash-lands on Earth. Lilo adopts the disguised alien, naming him <strong>Stitch</strong>, and introduces him to the concept of "Ohana" &ndash; meaning "family means nobody gets left behind or forgotten."</p>
<p data-sourcepos="8:1-8:495">As Jumba and Agent Pleakley (Billy Magnussen) are dispatched to retrieve Stitch, chaos ensues in the Pelekai household, further complicating Nani's efforts to maintain custody of Lilo. Through a series of misadventures and emotional challenges, Stitch gradually learns about love, loyalty, and empathy, transforming from a destructive force into a cherished member of Lilo's "Ohana." The film culminates in a thrilling showdown where the true meaning of family is tested and ultimately triumphs.</p>
